## Dependencies
### Color Sensors
~Download Adafruit_TCS34725 From Arduino IDE (Tools -> Manage Libraries)~

To connect multiple TCS34725 Color Sensors to the same microprocessor, we used: https://github.com/Fire7/Adafruit_TCS34725_SoftI2C
The library files (.h and .cpp, as of March 9, 2019) are included in this repository too.
